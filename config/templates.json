I'm reaching out regarding the {role} position or potential opportunities in the AI/Automation space.\n\nMy background includes work at Deloitte as a Data Analyst and a Master's from ASU. Recently, I've pivoted strictly into the GenAI space, building agentic AI workflow systems. A few highlights:\n• OrchestrateIQ: An IBM Watson Hackathon winner delivering agentic automation across HR, Sales, and Finance (https://ibm-aiorch-u5vh.vercel.app/).\n• Wildflower Coalition: A dynamic blog platform with integrated AI-driven admin tools.\n• Tech Stack: I live in Cursor and n8n, leveraging LangChain, Crew.ai, AWS Bedrock, and various LLMs to build autonomous agents that drive business impact.\n\nI don't just \"use\" AI—I build systems that leverage it for real-world innovation. I would love to discuss how I can help {company} stay at the forefront of this space.\n\nMy resume is attached. Are you available for a brief conversation this week?\n\n--\nThanks and regards,\nRikin Shah, MS, CSM, SAP.\nrshah88@asu.edu | (917)-238-5682\nLinkedIn | Portfolio | GitHub"
