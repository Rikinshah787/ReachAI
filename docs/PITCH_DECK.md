# ReachAI Pitch Deck 📊

## Slide 1: The Problem
Outbound sales is drowning. General outreach is being ignored, high-quality personalization is impossible to scale manually, and traditional tools are just "mailing lists" with a new name.

## Slide 2: The Solution
ReachAI. An autonomous outbound machine that uses agentic AI to find, research, and contact leads with the depth of a human and the scale of a server.

## Slide 3: The Product
- Autonomous discovery (No more manual searching).
- PDF context extraction (Deep research on autopilot).
- Precision delivery (Batch-based scheduling).

## Slide 4: Architecture
Built on a modular "Core" - allowing developers to swap agents, API providers (Hunter, Apollo), and communication protocols (SMTP, SendGrid).

## Slide 5: Market Opportunity
The Sales Engagement Platform (SEP) market is growing. Companies are desperate for "Quality over Quantity" at scale. ReachAI fills the gap between raw scraping and high-cost manual outreach.

## Slide 6: Business Model (The SaaS Play)
- **Open-Source Core**: Free for developers.
- **Premium UI / Pro Version**: Subscription for teams (unlocked at star milestone).
- **Enterprise**: Custom agents, SOC2 compliance, managed infrastructure.

## Slide 7: Open-Source Strategy
Using the "Milestone Unlock" (200 Stars) to drive community engagement and build a waitlist for the full platform launch.

## Slide 8: Roadmap
v1.0 is here. v2.0 is the full SaaS dashboard.
